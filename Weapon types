There are 5 types of damage in Terraria: melee, ranged, magic, summon and throwing damage.
Melee damage is usually close-range, but there are some exceptions.
Melee weapons can be spit into 6 categories: shortswords, broadswords, boomerangs, spears, flails and yoyos.
Ranged weapons are always long-range weapons and can be split into 2 categories: guns and bows.
Magic weapons are usually the strongest, but are tricky to use. They use mana.
Summon weapons spawn separate entities that fight automatically, acting as a separate creature. There are minions and sentries.
Lastly, throwing weapons are most often consumables like shurikens.
