There are 5 types of damage in Terraria: melee, ranged, magic, summon and throwing damage.
Melee damage is usually close-range, but there are some exceptions.
Melee weapons can be split into 6 categories: shortswords, broadswords, boomerangs, spears, flails and yoyos.
Ranged weapons are always long-range weapons and can be split into 2 categories: guns and bows.
Magic weapons are usually the strongest, but are tricky to use. They use mana.
Summon weapons spawn separate entities that fight automatically, acting as separate creatures. There are minions and sentries.
Lastly, throwing weapons are most often consumables, like shurikens.
NOTE:Throwing weapons can be good in the beginning of the game, but it gets worse and worse and absolutely abandoned post-mech bosses
